## Authentication
* Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or a system. It ensures that the entity claiming to be a specific user is indeed who they say they are.

## Authorization
* Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity and the policies set by the organization. Once a user is authenticated, the system determines what resources (files, folders, databases, etc.) they are allowed to access and what actions they can perform (read, write, execute, etc.). Authorization is typically based on roles, permissions, and access control lists (ACLs).

#### In summary, `authentication` is about `who you are`, and `authorization` is about `what you can do.`
